1. In the lab environment use Netmiko to connect to one of the Cisco NX-OS devices. You can find the IP addresses and username/passwords of the Cisco devices in the 'Lab Environment' email or alternatively in the ~/.netmiko.yml file. Simply print the router prompt back from this device to verify you are connecting to the device properly.
'''
'''
2. Add a second NX-OS device to your first exercise. Make sure you are using dictionaries to represent the two NX-OS devices. Additionally, use a for-loop to accomplish the Netmiko connection creation. Once again print the prompt back from the devices that you connected to.
